Jesse Llewellyn - Features
    - handleUse: Allows certain items to be used
    - Made Inventory an ArrayList: Allows the inventory to function more like a python list and simplifys code
    - Added SecretWin and Win: Uses handleUse function to implement a way to win and an easter egg
    - Fixed Room Class: Integrated Item Class, made by William, (removed the need for ItemDescriptions and grabbables list), and fixed toString to be compatible w/ pokeballRoom
